Video Image Extractor (Work in progress) (Use IBM Watson instead of CCV.js)

This website (in its current form) carries our face detection using the CCV.js library (https://github.com/liuliu/ccv).  As our next step, we plan to use IBM Watson's Hidden Markov Model (HMM) features to carry out this detection.
